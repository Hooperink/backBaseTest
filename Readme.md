This application provides 2 search algorithm:
1. For already sorted list (based on binary search)
2. For unsorted list (based on Java Streams)

In perfect case this application should be divided into 3 layers:
Domain, Data, Presentation.
Clear Architecture RULLEEZZ!!!!

I know that context in View Model is a bad thing, but I hope you won't be too hard on me.

Hope to join your team!!! Have a nice day!
